        "The main purpose which I have had in view in writing this book has been\n",
        "to present an account of Greek philosophy which, within strict limits\n",
        "of brevity, shall be at once authentic and interesting--_authentic_, as\n",
        "being based on the original works themselves, and not on any secondary\n",
        "sources; _interesting_, as presenting to the ordinary English reader,\n",
        "in language freed as far as possible from technicality and\n",
        "abstruseness, the great thoughts of the greatest men of antiquity on\n",
        "questions of permanent significance and value.  There has been no\n",
        "attempt to shirk the really philosophic problems which these men tried\n",
        "in their day to solve; but I have endeavoured to show, by a sympathetic\n",
        "treatment of them, that these problems were no mere wars of words, but\n",
        "that in fact the philosophers of twenty-four centuries ago were dealing\n",
        "with exactly similar difficulties as to the bases of belief and of\n",
        "right action as, under different forms, beset thoughtful men and women\n",
