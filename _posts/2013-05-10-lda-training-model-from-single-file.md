##LDA: Training a model from a single file

This page illustrates one simple example of LDA analysis using a text downloadable from the Project Gutenberg. As an example, we choose Descartes' [selections from the Principles of Philosophy](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4391). Download the plain text file and place it in a working directory with an appropriate name (here we call it `descartes.txt`). If necessary, you can cut off the proviso and save the main text only.
