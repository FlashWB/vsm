##LDA Tutorial: Exploring documents and words

The previous tutorial (link here) illustrated various methods to examine topics in an estimated LDA model. 
In this document we focus on the analysis of documents using LDA.
As before, we use the 100-topics LDA model trained with the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/), and assume the viewer object 'v' is created from an appropriate corpus and a model.
